#GA-Hackathon - Eventmatch

EventMatch was a result of a 24 hour hackathon, that took place as part of the General Assembly WDI 14 course.

It is a social event app to help people find events and then be paired up with other attendees of the event.  The idea came about as sometimes, people may not feel to attend an event they are interested in, as they feel everybody else already has connections, this helps to pair up people with a shared interest, and to help them feel more comfortable attending events.
